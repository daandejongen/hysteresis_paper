* The actual manuscript `hysteresis_manuscript.pdf` is produced by `hysteresis_manuscript.tex` (only file you need to run/compile in the TeX-editor), which imports
  
  - the `.tex` files in `tables/`, 
  
  - the `.pdf` files in `images/` and 
  
  - `references.bib`.
  
* The tables and images are produced by the $\textsf{R}$-scripts in the folders `simulation_studies/`, `major_depression/` and `speed_accuracy_trade_off/` or hand-made.

* `images/` contains a folder `image_makers/` with some Miscrosoft Powerpoint files (`.pptx`) that I used to create or combine images.
